1. The client performs an action on the website and sends a request to your server.
2. The request arrives at the server and is passed to your cPanel system.
3. When the request reaches the server, the mechanism that operates the request depends on the AJAX technology you have chosen to use. Most AJAX-based technologies use XMLHttpRequest or fetch API to send the request to the server.
4. The server performs the required action and returns the result to the client. The result may be data in JSON or XML format, or even plain text without further processing.
Each message in this process is sent using the HTTP protocol, thus enabling communication with the server. The data is sent through GET. Every message sent requires server-side actions, such as reading data from the database or performing an action in server-side code.
